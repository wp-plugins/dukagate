== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the make payment button not working? =

Nine out of ten times, this is because there is a javascript error somewhere on your site.  The first place to look is your theme - try and run Dukagate using the default WordPress theme to confirm if it is your theme that is failing you.

Another reason is usually the pdf folder inside of Dukagate. Please try make it writable

= Why doesn't Dukagate work for me?  It seems to work for everyone else =

No.  Nothing is wrong with you. :)

We test Dukagate on a large number of different server set-ups and envrionments and we are satisfied that it does work in these environments.  However, the number of different environments 'out there' is infinite and we cannot possibly test on every single environment.  If everything that you try fails to work, perharps you should move your site to one of the more common web hosts?
